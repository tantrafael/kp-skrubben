# KP Skrubben

## Project
Client: Bonnier Tidskrifter (now Dagens Nyheter)  
Time: 2009, 2 months

## Description
I was asked to create a dollhouse-like playground, as the main feature for the younger visitors of [KP's website](https://www.kpwebben.se/). I made a dynamic house structure that children could extend with new rooms in available directions. You created a room of your own, decorated it and added things to play with, like a football to bounce for example. The room was saved the way you created it. Everyone could explore each other's rooms and play in them.
